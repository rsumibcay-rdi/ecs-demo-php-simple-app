Integrates Meta Box's custom fields with Beaver Themer.

== Description ==

Easily select and show custom fields created by the [Meta Box](https://metabox.io) plugin in the [Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/) field connection from a dropdown.

The plugin works for all field types. And you don't have to remember the field name or field ID to type. You just need to select it from the dropdown list.

See it in action in the following video:
